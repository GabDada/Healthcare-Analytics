# Diabetes Care: Why are Patients Dropping off Glucose Monitoring & Medications after 1 year

In today's growing diabetes population, continuous glucose monitoring offers the potential to change lives and bring fresh insight into how patients manage their conditions. However a number challenges including affordability, awareness and copay limitations still plague widespread utlization. The market is highly competitive as such it has become imperative for Manufacturers to continue growing adoption, reduce churn and compete favourably.

This project explores the application of data science techniques, specifically segmentation and clustering, to achieve meaningful patient segmentation while uncovering the charcteristics of patients who are less likely to be active after 12 months for different reasons.

Applying segmentation and clustering analysis to patient data, we identified 8 distinct patient groups, their peculiarities, possible reasons for churn, and discuss necessary downstream triggers and market access interventions to grow utilization.

Methodology:

1: Exploratory Data Analysis: For prelimary insights into the AS-IS business situation.

2: S-A-UT Segmentation Framework: Design and Implementation of a state-of-the-art framework (Severity-Affordability- Utilization) for patient segmentation based on market access domain knowledge.

3: Hypothesis Testing: ANOVA to further sense-check results from our Framework.

4: K-Means Clustering: Implemented K-Means clustering analysis to further validate patient segments from the SAUT framewrok.

5: Results & Discussions: Business questions are addressed and possible interventions discussed.
